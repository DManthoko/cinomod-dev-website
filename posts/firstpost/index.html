<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Welcome to my first my post.</p>
<p>For the past year or so, I have been meaning to create my own static website but never really got around to doing it. Then someday, I came across a <a href="https://dev.to/bholmesdev/before-building-your-next-static-site-with-react-consider-this-2b60">post</a> on <a href="http://dev.to">dev.to</a> that spoke about this very same topic I was interested in. In that post, the author Ben talks about 11ty, which is a static website generated I have not heard about before.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of weeks after reading that article, I checked out the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> page and at first, did find it a bit a hassle to navigate through the site. Simply reading through some of the pages didn't help me learn how to use the thing. However, after following the <a href="https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/">Learn Eleventy from Scratch</a> tutorial, which is was quite straighforward to follow along, I was able to get an idea of how to get started in 11ty.</p>
<p>Although I do know how to code in Java and a bit of JavaScript, I can honestly say that I am quite to web development. So, to start of this very website you are reading, I simply used the <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">eleventy-base-blog</a> starter project to work from. Thus, my intention with this site is to explore web development a bit more.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!!</p>

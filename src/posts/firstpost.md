Hi there,

Welcome to my first my post.

For the past year or so, I have been meaning to create my own static website but never really got around to doing it. Then someday, I came across a [post](https://dev.to/bholmesdev/before-building-your-next-static-site-with-react-consider-this-2b60) on dev.to that spoke about this very same topic I was interested in. In that post, the author Ben talks about 11ty, which is a static website generated I have not heard about before.

Fast forward a couple of weeks after reading that article, I checked out the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) page and at first, did find it a bit a hassle to navigate through the site. Simply reading through some of the pages didn't help me learn how to use the thing. However, after following the [Learn Eleventy from Scratch](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com/) tutorial, which is was quite straighforward to follow along, I was able to get an idea of how to get started in 11ty.

Although I do know how to code in Java and a bit of JavaScript, I can honestly say that I am quite to web development. So, to start of this very website you are reading, I simply used the [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) starter project to work from. Thus, my intention with this site is to explore web development a bit more.

Thanks for reading!!
